"""«Кадр сцены»: a new scene's start frame drawn by FLUX.2 Klein from the photos of the people
in it (picture.edit) - the hero with the face from their photo in the scene's own place, framing and first action. The
picture becomes the scene's start photo (it is shot i2v from it, like «Начать с фото»), and `start_en` says what is on
it, so the writer needn't look. The face on the frame is checked against the photo (SFace); below the aim of its
framing (FACE_AIM) another seed is tried, the best of them stays and the scene is told when none passed FACE_MIN. One model load for a batch of scenes.
A scene in a place with a picture («Места», places.py) gets it as the last reference: the same set on every scene of
that place, from the scene's own camera.
